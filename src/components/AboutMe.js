            <p>Hi! I am a front end web developer with a particular interest and passion for React and its capability to build powerful UI. 
               I have a Bachelor's Degree in Art and Design with an emphasis in Graphic Design. 
               When I realized that graphic design wasn't for me I took a detour to do social work and marketing but started to miss the creativity and design I was able to harness during my degree. 
               I have now found my way back to the design world with a career pivot to front-end web dev. I started my coding journey in the latter part of 2020 and haven't looked back!
